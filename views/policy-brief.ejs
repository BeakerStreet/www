				The COVID-19 pandemic is a global problem, and governments and corporations around the world are innovating to try and save lives. Contact tracing applications may be able to help. However, these technologies greatly increase the risk of surveillance to individuals, by governments, corporations, and bad actors. <br /><br />
				We are still in the very early stages of the proliferation of mass contact tracing applications, and it is too early to tell how effective they will be. The global pursuit of these technologies however compel us to pursue a truly private version of them - one that cannot be abused.<br /><br />
      				sharetrace is an open source application for use by the global software community and governments and public health authorities. It is intended to empower individual citizens to help governments, health authorities and themselves by proactively taking actions to reduce their risk of contracting and spreading COVID-19, and in doing so improve the quality of life of those communities affected by the disease.<br />
				</p>

				General Information about Contact Tracing Applications
				</header>
				<p>
				Contact tracing technology has been used to support public health authorities’ manual efforts to trace exposure to COVID-19 in various locations around the world. Contact tracing technologies’ design is conventionally informed by two considerations:<br />a) centralised contact tracing operations; and<br />b) decentralised activity recall.
				</p>
				<p>
				<i>Centralised contact tracing operations.</i> When a person is diagnosed with COVID-19, they are generally contacted by public health authorities’ contact tracing teams. All contact tracing operations are centralised in this team.<br /><br />
				<i>Decentralised recall.</i> Contact tracers generally ask the person diagnosed to recall all the places they have been in the last 14 days, as well as the persons they have been in contact with. This activity mapping is necessary to identify close contacts they may have caught the virus from and given the virus to, so as to establish links between clusters of cases. Individuals usually refer to their schedules and social media history but it is usually impossible to know what close contact they may have had with unacquainted contacts, such as at restaurants, large social/work events, or on public transport.<br /><br />
				Contact/proximity tracing solutions attempt to plug this gap by recording who you have been in contact with, but not where.<br />
				</p>
				<header>
				How Contact/Proximity Contact Tracing Works		
				</header>
				<p>
				Downloading contact tracing applications can be compelled or voluntary and generally requires that the user register using a mobile number. Thereafter, the app keeps a record of other users of the same contact tracing application that you have been in close proximity to, and stores all of this information on the phone with scrambled identifiers in an attempt to protect the identity of users. When approached by a contact tracer, the app user is requested to upload the data that is stored on their local device, often to a central server owned by the public health authority to facilitate contact tracing.
				</p>
				<p>
				In general, a minimum of personal data (usually data that will identify a person) is attempted to be collected. When the app is installed, users are generally asked to register with a mobile number. This is stored in a secured server together with a random anonymised User ID, and it is what allows individuals to be contacted so that he may receive the appropriate guidance and care.<br /><br />
				Contact/proximity tracing applications can have a variety of access to location data, from full, to minimal, to none. Often, but not always, an important tool for limiting invasion of privacy liability is for these applications to rely on Bluetooth proximity signals instead of global location signals. When this option is not taken the risk of surveillance is much higher and privacy must be addressed in other ways.<br /><br />
				Generally, the intention is that a user’s identity is not revealed to other users. Generally, apps create a temporary ID, generated by encrypting the User ID so that only a centralised public health authority can decrypt it. The temporary ID is changed frequently. When the contact/proximity tracing app is running, it regularly scans for other nearby app users using Bluetooth. When it is able to establish a connection with such nearby users it records the temporary ID of the nearby phone, together with information about the phone’s model, Bluetooth signal strength, and time. This information is often stored on the phone to further limit invasion of privacy liability, and is never uploaded to the public health authority (or shared with anyone else) unless explicitly authorised and initiated by the user.<br /><br />
				Records are usually only uploaded during contact tracing. In the event a contact tracing application user is contacted by a public health authority contact tracer, they are generally then asked to upload the proximity history stored.<br /><br />
				Digital contact tracing records will facilitate, but not replace, contact tracing. Generally, when digital contact tracing records are received by contact tracing team they are generally able to view the phone numbers of probable close contacts. Once they have the list of probable contacts, they often cold call these persons. Users generally agree during onboarding to be contacted by contact tracers if they have been exposed. In situations where the contact tracers only know the mobile number, and not the name or how/where the person could have come into contact with a COVID-19 case, the communications protocol is designed such that the contact tracer must often exercise judgment to account for systematic biases, e.g. short-duration contact in an unventilated space or phones not actively carried by owners, in deciding on the necessary follow-up. In some situations, the public health authorities are able to secure the unique identifiers of the device by fiat, effectively turning the contact/proximity tracing application into a mass citizen surveillance apparatus.<br /><br />

				User-generative risk tracing - an alternative approach<br />
				</header>
			      	<p>
			      	sharetrace proposes User-generative risk tracing as an alternative methodology to contact/proximity tracing applications, leveraging citizen data ownership instead of trust and local storage to guarantee privacy. The sharetrace application use can still be compelled or voluntary, and can require the user register with either an email address or mobile number. Thereafter, all personal data needed by the sharetrace application is stored in private personal data accounts that are accessible only to the user. sharetrace keeps a record of other sharetrace users you have been in close proximity to in this personal data account, and maintains a legal data access agreement to that information to be able to power the application. It is not required that any data be stored on any centralised sharetrace database. If a contact tracer requires access to the sharetrace users’ information, the user is requested to grant access to that information for the purposes of their tracing activity, but that information is not uploaded anywhere new. The user thus remains in control of this information, and can deny access to it at any point, such as when the health crisis is over.
			      	</p>
			      	<p>
				Personal data can be collected freely and without free of invasion of privacy or surveillance. When the sharetrace application is installed, users are issued a personal data account that is hosted in the cloud, and that is legally and functionally their own. They are typically asked to register with either an email address or a mobile number, and are issued a unique identifier for their personal data account. Their personal data account identifier is stored securely by the personal data account provider. The information that allows individuals to be contacted in the event of their exposure to the disease, and the information that allows the tracing of their contacts and networks, are all stored privately inside this user-owned store. Any rich data about the user can reasonably be stored and managed in the safety of the users’ own personal data account, including Bluetooth proximity tracings, GPS signal, and more.<br /><br />
				Granular and user-controlled data access agreements. The user is generally able to sign legally-binding data access agreements with the SafeCare application and public health authorities to access some or all of their privately-stored information, as needed. The nature of these agreements can be changed only with the explicit involvement of the individual user.<br /><br />
				sharetrace can safely access location and other rich, intimate user data. Because all data remains securely on the user side, sharetrace has less exposure to the risks of state or corporate surveillance. GPS location can be comfortably stored in the users’ private database, alongside Bluetooth proximity registrations and personal health information. This information can only be made accessible to the public health authority with the express permission of the SafeTrace user, and is subject to external review by oversight authorities.<br /><br />
				A user’s identity can never revealed to other users. In creating a private repository for user data, sharetrace creates a system where user identities cannot be exposed without the permission of the user. These identities can be exposed to the public health authority under a variety of models, but never without the explicit permission of the user. User identities and identifying keys can be changed frequently, and when the sharetrace application is running it can safely and regularly scan for other nearby app users using Bluetooth as well as tracking the users’ GPS location. When it is able to establish a connection with such nearby users it can record some identifiers of nearby phones, together with information about the phone’s model, Bluetooth signal strength, and time, encrypting some or all of this information as necessary. There is no need for this information to be stored exclusively on the device, or uploaded to the public health authority (or shared with anyone else), for any reason.<br /><br />
				Records are only made accessible to the sharetrace application and the public health authority during contact tracing. In the event a contact tracing application user needs to be contacted by a public health authority contact tracer, a request is made to grant access to the users’ proximity history, in whole or in part, as needed. Restrictions and oversight over this information sharing request can be tailored to the requirements of the public health authority, and in the most private of architectures full-scale access to all information can be revoked by the citizen at any time.<br /><br />
				</p>
				<p>
				sharetrace is presented as an alternative to contact/proximity tracing using Bluetooth and centralised data storage by a trusted authority. Even minimal data capture for the purposes of contact tracing is still very invasive. Some proposed systems could be used to potentially track all of the human interactions of more than three billion people across the planet, and that they can maintain that data just in case hospitals and public health authorities need to use it. Supporting that technology requires us to place quite a lot of trust in these organisations.
				</p>
				<p>
				sharetrace believes we shouldn’t have to trust any organisation that much, and so it proposes that all data be stored by citizens themselves instead.
